24. There are various popular accounts of the ambitious and vainglorious 
efforts of our kings in this matter. Still, I think, it is interesting to know 
accurately the original plan of the precinct, as it was fixed by Romulus. From 
the ox market, where we see the brazen statue of a bull, because that animal is 
yoked to the plough, a furrow was drawn to mark out the town, so as to embrace 
the great altar of Hercules; then, at regular intervals, stones were placed 
along the foot of the Palatine hill to the altar of Consus, soon afterwards, to 
the old Courts, and then to the chapel of Larunda. The Roman forum and the 
Capitol were not, it was supposed, added to the city by Romulus, but by Titus 
Tatius. In time, the precinct was enlarged with the growth of Rome's fortunes. 
The boundaries now fixed by Claudius may be easily recognized, as they are 
specified in the public records.
