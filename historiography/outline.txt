Hanlon's Razor:  "NEver Attribute to Mallice that which is adequetly explained
	by stupidity"

Question:  	How do we use the planet?

		How does the planet support our lives?

		How do we work with and not against the environment?
	
One article setting the theme and two case studies

Main points for Missed Connections

Brief bio:  Tina Loo
	Canadian and environmental historian at UBC
	researches forced relcations, development and the welfare state

Themes

	Thesis:  
		Exploring the interplay between the environment and politcs can
		be productive for both historians of the environment and 
		historians of Canada.

	Interconnectedness:  
		Early CDN environmental historians focused on BNA:
			timber
			fish
			fur
		Not as much on its effects in the European metropol
			Trace the effects on other areas
				Nicle, 
				fur,
				oil
				uranium

	Resource extraction in Politics:
		Oil opposition is 'unpatriotic'
			Albertan oil dependancy

		forces interconnectedness with cities and sewage
			Vancouver Island

	Environmental adaptation:
		PFRA Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Act and Administration
			1935:  a small economic recession
				a drought!
			irrigation and manage water development and 
			conservation

		70s & 80s, equalization of tax revenue
			higher priority than OECD Countries

		'68 Trudeau (the elder) "Every Canadian has the right to a 
		good life whatever the province or territory he lives in.
			Information
			Soil
			fish
			how to act
	
	Very Canadian, not much of the World

Main points for Whither Wintego

	The Damning of  a dam.

	1970s project to build yet another dam along the Churchill River
		
		Wattage grew by 50% from 69-73
		Growth forecast 5% - 10% per annumn
		Src	
			Water:	35%
			Coal:	50%
			
		Dam 46m tall 
		x 
		1280m Long, 
		25000 hectares effected for flooding
		3.5 years
		$140 million

	CRS Churchill River Study:

		Assess the Social, economic and environmental imacts of:

			Developing the damn site on the river,

			turning the Churchill and Reindeer river areas
			into a national park

			Developing a provincial park in the Huges Lakes area in
			Manatobah

			options when the licence for two other damns expire.

		Uncovoured problems with land claims, hunting and fishing rights,
		archeological sites, water lilies flooded out, beavers, insects,
		airation of water, 

		On direct benifits:  $314 million, cost of indirect:  one to one

		No real economic benifit foro locals.

		Wintego may be more expensive than alternate options.

	Churchill River BoI.

		Echoed CRS:  Environmental preservation meant that the Cree &c
		could live off the river.
	
	Dam damned.
		
		1991, 70% of energy was from Coal, today Saskatchewan is one 
		of the worlds highest per capita emitters.

Connect to broad themes
	Enviornment sustained life and some tourism, economic costs were
	prohibitive.  Politics may shift with climate change.

Main Points for Irrigation Infrastructure, TEchnocratic Faith, and 
Irregularities of Vision:  Canada's Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Adminstration
in Ghana, 1965-1970.

	PFRA
		do what it did in the Praries to help manage the resources
		of the Volta River

		Cold War:  bring Ghana on side as a fellow member 

		Provide food stability by helping prevent water scarcity.

		Start with pilot before moving larger
	
	Exection:  Twinning of civil servints to train Ghanaian staff.

	Challanges:  No technical data, political pressure to see results
		poor housing for Canadian staff, Delhi Belly.  Poor
		Intercultural training (black market explaining absenteeism).

	Dobson Report:	Ghanaian bureaucracy in sufficient commitment, 
	training, supplies, and supervision.

	There were dams built however
		
		There were increases in schistosomiasis, spread by snails and 
		habatat.

		Malaria
		onchocerciasis
		elephaantitis

		Health teams knew this 1949 Aswan Dam Egypt

Is it appropriate and productive to focus environmental issues by contrasting
the long and short term ?

Is Economics the key drivers of environmental change?  If so, why, if not, why
not?
